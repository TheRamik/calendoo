# Calendoo

A calendar to-do combination web application that stores your to-do's day by days! This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses Mongoose as the ORM for MongoDB.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/todos](http://localhost:3000/api/todos). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/todos/index.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
